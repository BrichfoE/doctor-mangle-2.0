# doctor-mangle-2.0

This is a continuation of https://github.com/BrichfoE/DocMangle now that I'm not totally new to coding.  

I still enjoy the concept and am now working on using design patterns in my code, so this seemed like an opportuintiy to improve an existing code base which was always intended for learning.  Plus I hope to make a game in Unity out of it if I can make the right library for it.
